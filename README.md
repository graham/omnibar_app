# omnibar_app

The goal of OmniBarApp is to make creating simple web applications easy. While this is primarily for my personal projects, I figured that making it public will do two things 

1. Others might benefit from seeing how i've built this.
2. Others might re-use some or all of the code.
3. Having it be public means I'll be better about how I write my code.

## Events

Pretty much everything that a application writer will do is based on some sort of internal event. The application will fire off events as they occur. But in order to make the application pretty good at dealing with all sorts of different goals, it isn't going to care about how an application builder does their thing. So even though the application provides a good starting point, you'll still have to do your own syncing and organization.

OmniBarApp is modeling how iOS works, it's a framework for building, but it doesn't present you with much beyond a ton of best practices. I have a love hate relationship with how iOS works, but the reality is, once you learn how everything works, you can get a ton done in a very short period of time.

OmniBarApp has the same focus: Need to build an application quickly? Good OmniBarApp will help you do that; Need to build a super custom application with all sorts of custom design and functionality, sorry, you'll have to build that yourself.

The goal of OmniBarApp is to jumpstart you to the point where you can "Build that pretty quickly". Every engineer says it, but few can actually do it in a "really short period of time, like a weekend."
