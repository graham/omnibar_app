# Plans

- Transformers that can be turned off by the user.
- build an invisible textfield that the user types in, then render that textfield into something pretty. This will be the basis for "SearchTransformers" which will allow plugins to add visual changes to the search bar (without modifying the actual content).
- Create item transformers that can modify the visual appearance of the item div, again, without being able to modify the underlying data.
- Settings are pretty difficult, but it should probably be a subclass fo the list view.

#Today

- gutter div for search status, general info.
- Parser for text to item -> #done.
