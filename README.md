# omnibar_app

The goal of OmniBarApp is to make creating simple web applications easy. While this is primarily for my personal projects, I figured that making it public will do two things 

1. Others might benefit from seeing how i've built this.
2. Others might re-use some or all of the code.
3. Having it be public means I'll be better about how I write my code.
